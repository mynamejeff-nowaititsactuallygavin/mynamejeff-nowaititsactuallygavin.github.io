    <p>Sipping a drink of water, no matter the material of the cup, must always
occur silently. If you slurp your cups of water with no regard of what you sound like
to the outside world then let me give you a reality check. <b> Everybody hates it when you sip loudly. Stop. Slurping. Slurping is practically illegal and you're a sociopath for doing it.</b> </p>

<p> Uh yeah basically drinking through a straw is really easy but i always see people do it incorrectly
and it really bothers me so im just going to go a little in-depth, but you should still be able to keep
up with me if you arent an absolute idiot. just kidding, <b> okay </b> 
like all the other methods <b> (EXCEPT FOR SLURPING) </b>, "strawing" water is an art, and since drinking
water is one of the purest art forms, it must be taken <i> absolutely seriously.... </i> <br>
basically all you do is wrap your mouth around the end of the straw pointing to your face hole,
and you suck the straw. HOWEVER there is an alternative method that is much more effective 
than this <b> boring, standard one. <a href="strawing.html"> Click for more information. </a> </b>

<p> This method is not very common but is fun if you are bored of methods such as Sipping or "Strawing." 
As the name suggests, The "Four Legged Mammal" method involves getting down on your knees, and licking up the water
with your tongue, I've seen some people lift their arms off the ground while doing this, requiring them to 
use muscles in their stomach/hip area to keep their head over the water. Most four legged mammals, like cats and dogs, have specially 
shaped mouths so they can lift mouthfuls of water with ease, Humans do not have this kind of tongue, so it takes training to
teach your tongue how to cup the water, and lift it into your mouth. <a href="four legged.html"><b> Click this to see more. </b></a href> </p>
